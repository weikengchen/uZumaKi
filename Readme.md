# Goals

1. **Variety of Systems**: Numerous ZK proof systems exist, each with unique features and optimizations, necessitating a method for comparison.
2. **Targeted Applications**: Different systems are tailored for specific use cases, making benchmarking essential to identify the best fit for a particular application.
3. **No Universal Solution**: Each system has its own trade-offs in terms of efficiency and capabilities, highlighting the need for a comparative analysis.
4. **Rapid Evolution**: The fast-paced innovation in ZK proofs requires a way to track and evaluate new advancements and their impact.
5. **Computational Efficiency**: Benchmarking provides insights into the proof generation and verification speeds of different systems.
6. **Scalability Insights**: Understanding how systems handle increasing computational complexities is crucial for large-scale applications.
7. **Security Comparison**: Evaluating varying security levels across different systems is vital for ensuring data integrity and privacy.
8. **Resource Demand Analysis**: Assessing CPU and memory usage helps in determining the practical deployment of ZK systems.
9. **Informed Decision-Making**: Empirical data from benchmarking aids developers and researchers in choosing the most suitable system.
10. **Standardization Aid**: Benchmarking supports the standardization process in ZK proofs by establishing performance and best practice benchmarks.

Benchmarking ZK proofs is not just about performance metrics; it's a comprehensive process that evaluates suitability for specific applications, scalability, security, and practicality, thereby guiding the evolving landscape of cryptographic privacy and data integrity solutions.

## DSL circuit Benchmarks without proving system

- Independent of proving scheme limitations: Some proving systems may have limitations or optimizations that can skew the understanding of a DSL's capabilities. Comparing DSLs independently allows for an evaluation that is not influenced by such factors.
- By comparing DSLs independently of specific proving systems, you can focus on the efficiency and optimization of circuit design. This allows for an assessment of how well each DSL facilitates the creation of efficient and optimized circuits.

- Analysis under heavy load
- Tooling and ecosystem support
